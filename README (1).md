🎬 Movie Slot Booking System (SQL Project)

📘 Overview :

The Movie Slot Booking System is a SQL-based project designed to manage and analyze movie bookings, customer data, payments, and show details.
It demonstrates SQL querying, filtering, aggregation, joins, subqueries, and data manipulation operations within a relational database.
This project is ideal for learners and professionals aiming to showcase their SQL skills — including CRUD operations, joins, groupings, and advanced filtering.

🗂️ Database Schema :

The project uses a database named movie_slot with the following main tables:

Table Name	Description
movie_booking	Contains details about movies such as title, genre, and release date.
movie_booking_customers	Stores information about customers (name, city, contact details).
movie_booking_shows	Holds details about movie shows, including show date, ticket price, and linked theatre.
movie_booking_theatre	Information about theatres where movies are shown.
movie_booking_booking	Records of customer bookings, number of seats booked, and booking date.
movie_booking_payments	Stores payment information (amount, status, payment date, etc.).

🧩 Skills Demonstrated :

SQL CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
Subqueries
Grouping & Aggregation (SUM(), COUNT(), HAVING)
Sorting & Filtering (ORDER BY, BETWEEN, LIKE)
Data Relationships in a normalized database.

📊 Example Use Cases :

Retrieve all movies released in 2024
Find customers who booked more than two shows
List all pending payments
Display total seats booked per show
Show movies with ticket prices between 200 and 400.

💡 Future Enhancements :

Add stored procedures for automated report generation
Create views for complex analytical queries
Integrate with a frontend (e.g., React + Node.js) for visualization
Implement triggers for real-time payment updates.
